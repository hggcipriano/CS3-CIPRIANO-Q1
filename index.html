    Terra is a website that aims to spread awareness about the current environmental issues
that surround our planet and teach ways on how to take part in eliminating them. Recently, scientists
have been warning us about how our global temperature can increase by 3.2 degrees Celsius in 2100 if
we don’t act on our global carbon emissions by 2025. This issue alone tells us the crucial need for global
awareness about our environment. Awareness leads to learning, learning leads to action, and action leads
to change. By spreading awareness, this website helps in sparking the desire to act and make a change
among other people.
