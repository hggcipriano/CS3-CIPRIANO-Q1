              Deforestation is “the purposeful clearing of land” for agricultural and commercial purposes. Around the world, 15 billion trees are lost annually due to deforestation. This causes more carbon dioxide emissions in our atmosphere since only a few trees will be able to take them in for photosynthesis. This also causes soil erosion because of the absence of tree roots underground. Moreover, this causes the loss of habitat for many animals, eventually leading to the loss of biodiversity.

              Global warming is defined as the long-term increase in our global temperature. This is caused by the greenhouse effect, wherein greenhouse gases from our planet trap heat in our atmosphere. Even the slightest increase in our global temperature can cause floods, wildfires, and droughts. Aside from these, global warming increases sea levels and disrupts sea habitats. According to the World Climate Research Programme, if we don’t act on this issue, we might experience an annual average global temperature 1.1 to 1.7 degrees Celsius higher than it was from 1850-1900 for the next four years.

              Air pollution refers to the contamination of the air due to harmful pollutants such as chemicals and particles. This is more common in urban areas or large cities than in rural areas or provinces. Some sources of air pollution are emissions from factories and cars, ashes from volcanoes, and smoke from wildfires. To humans, it has short-term and long-term effects. Short-term effects include irritation and illnesses such as pneumonia and bronchitis. Long-term effects, on the other hand, include more harmful ones such as birth defects, heart disease, lung cancer, emphysema, and multiple organ damage.

            <div>
              Water pollution refers to the contamination of bodies of water due to toxic substances such as oil, trash, and chemicals. It is usually caused by human activities such as the use of pesticides in farming, the use of plastics daily, the intentional dumping of trash in bodies of water, and oil spills. These activities lead to the destruction of habitats for aquatic animals, eventually leading to the loss of biodiversity. In addition, these activities make water undrinkable for humans, spread diseases such as hepatitis and cholera, and increase the mortality rate of infants.

              Currently, there are 41,415 endangered species in the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s Red List of Threatened Species. Almost 40% of these species are threatened with extinction. This is species endangerment—the increased risk of extinction for animals and plants. It is usually caused by habitat loss because of environmental issues such as those mentioned above. Moreover, it is also caused by genetic variation from inbreeding (for animals) or reproduction with close family members. The apparent effect of this is biodiversity loss.
