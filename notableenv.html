        <span id="quote">“You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words. And yet I’m one of the lucky ones. People are suffering. People are dying. Entire ecosystems are collapsing. We are in the beginning of a mass extinction, and all you can talk about is money and fairy tales of eternal economic growth. How dare you!” -Greta Thunberg</span>

        Valerie Jane Morris-Goodall, or Jane Goodall for short, is a British environmentalist from London that advocates for the conservation of chimpanzees and animals in general. In 1960, she conducted a long-term research in Gombe Stream National Park in Tanzania, studying the behaviors of chimpanzees there. For 30 years, she came up with many findings; for instance, she discovered that chimpanzees are able to make and use tools just like humans and that they are omnivores. She wrote and published numerous books that cover her findings about animals and nature.
